This repository contains the code and experiments used for the final project of PMML, where I evaluated how randomized projections affect prior choices in Bayesian PCA. Projections preserve reconstruction error and speed up inference but erase sparsity patterns across priors like Gaussian, Student-t, Laplace, Log-quadratic, and Spike-and-Slab.

Full results and analysis in [here](Robust-Priors-for-Bayesian-PCA.pdf), including synthetic data, Olivetti Faces benchmarks, BBVI implementation, and practical guidelines (use Spike-and-Slab for robustness).
